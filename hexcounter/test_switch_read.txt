Test: Read Switches and Display Value
======================================
This program continuously reads the input switches
and displays their value. Use this to verify INP 4
is working correctly before debugging the hex counter.

ADDR  CODE  INSTRUCTION     DESCRIPTION
----  ----  -----------     -----------
00    90    GHI R0          D = 0 (R0.1 is 0 after reset)
01    B2    PHI R2          R2.1 = 0
02    F8    LDI 30
03    30                    D = 0x30
04    A2    PLO R2          R2 = 0030 (scratch pointer)
05    E2    SEX R2          X = 2 (R2 is data pointer)
06    6C    INP 4           Read switches into D and M[R2]
07    64    OUT 4           Display switch value
08    22    DEC R2          Fix R2 (OUT incremented it)
09    30    BR 06           Loop back to read switches

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Display should show the hex value of the switch positions
- Flipping switches should change the display immediately
- All switches DOWN = 00
- All switches UP = FF
- Switch 7 only UP = 80
- Switch 0 only UP = 01

If display shows 00 regardless of switch positions,
there may be a hardware or timing issue with the switch input circuit.
